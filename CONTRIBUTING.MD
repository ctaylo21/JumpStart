# Contributing to JumpStart

Want to contribute? Great! Here's a quick guide to get started.

## Submitting a Pull Request

Please use the [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html) for any code changes. The typical process will be the following:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from master
2. Any changes that can be documented, should be documented
3. All `npm` commands should still correctly function
4. Code should lint properly via `npm run lint`
5. Create the pull request!

- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)
