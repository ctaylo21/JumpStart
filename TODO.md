1. Move to real version of html-webpack plugin once (it's merged)[[https://github.com/jantimon/html-webpack-plugin/pull/823#issuecomment-36507]
2. Resolve ajv-keywords@3.1.0 requires a peer of ajv@^6.0.0 but none is installed.
   You must install peer dependencies yourself. Could be (npm issue)[https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/19877]
